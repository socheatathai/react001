# React 001 - My First GitHub Project

Welcome to my first GitHub project! ðŸš€

## About This Project

This project marks the beginning of my journey into web development. It's the first time I've initialized a project on GitHub, and I'm excited to share my progress with you.

### Goals:
- Learn the basics of coding.
- Create a simple and easy for users.
- Explore the world of web development.
- Continue growing and building more complex projects.

## Why I Started

I wanted to dive into coding and understand how websites work. This is my first step, and I'm eager to learn everything I can about web development, from HTML and CSS to JavaScript, frameworks, and beyond.

Thank you for taking the time to read my documentation and follow along with my progress. Stay tuned for updates as I continue learning and building!

## A few word i got from my experience
- the biggest thing always start from the smallest
- everything will start by the time
- time will be teach you
